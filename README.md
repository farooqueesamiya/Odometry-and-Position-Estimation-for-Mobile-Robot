# Arduino Robot Control and Odometry

## Objective

The Arduino Robot Control and Odometry project aims to provide a comprehensive platform for controlling a mobile robot using an Arduino Uno board, L293D motor driver, two speed sensors (wheel encoders), and odometry calculations. The primary objective is to offer an educational resource for beginners and enthusiasts to delve into robot control, positioning, and motor control principles using Arduino.

## Functionalities

1. **Motor Control**: The code includes motor control logic using an L293D motor driver to manage two gear motors. This enables basic control over motor speed and direction.

2. **Wheel Encoder Odometry**: The project integrates two speed sensors (wheel encoders) to count the ticks generated by the wheels as the robot moves. These counts serve as the basis for calculating the robot's position and orientation through odometry calculations.

3. **Odometry Calculation**: The `odometry` function calculates the robot's position (x, y) and orientation (phi) based on changes in wheel distances. It updates the robot's position in real-time, providing valuable feedback.

4. **Serial Communication**: The code employs Serial communication to output the robot's current position (x, y) to the serial monitor. This facilitates real-time monitoring during testing and development.
